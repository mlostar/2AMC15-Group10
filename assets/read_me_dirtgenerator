dirt_size = (x_size_patch, y_size_patch)
    defines the dirt patch sizes
goal(x_start, y_start, x_size, y_size)
    puts a dirt square in dirt patches
rand_goal(x_start, y_start, x_size, y_size)
    puts a dirt square with random size rand_size = (0 - x_size/y_size)
    at a random starting location within rand_start = (x_start, x_start-rand_size)
small_goal_size = (x_size, y_size)
    defines the small goals size
small_goal(x_start, y_start, x_size, y_size)
    puts (x_size / small_goal_size) number of rand_goal in size small_goal_size
p_dirt = (is_p_dirt: BOOL, p_dirt: float)
    rand_goal have a p_dirt chance of appearing
    default is_p_dirt = False, p_dirt = 0.8

So if you have all options on:
it makes puts dirt randomly of the size [small_goal_size] with chance [p_dirt]
which are divided in patches of [dirt_size]
